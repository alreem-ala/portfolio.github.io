This portfolio is meant to be just for the class “Communications lab” to portray the main projects that we worked on throughout the semester. I tried to make it meaningful as it contains a few things about myself on the main, about page. The deer is supposed to represent my name, and the branches of the palm are 7, as in 7 emirates of the UAE. The projects page after that is a table with all four projects, each icon representing what the project theme is. This page shows more of an NYUAD setting as if one is sitting in a table by the palms. The last page is a contact information page where I provide my Gmail as well as my GitHub accounts.
